	"content": "STEP 1. First STUDY the meaning of the original term.\nSTEP 2. COMPARE the term with other terms that have similar meanings.\nSTEP 3. THINK about possible solutions for re-expressing the idea and tentatively CHOOSE the most appropriate.\nSTEP 4. CHECK existing service books, and Scripture, in your language to see how these terms have been translated in the past.\n For example, the Greek word διάκονος diakonos means \u0026ldquo;servant.\u0026rdquo; However, English Orthodox service books consistently translate διάκονος as \u0026ldquo;deacon\u0026rdquo; when referring to the ordained ministry of the deacon. If service books (or the New Testament) in your language already have a standard word for \u0026ldquo;deacon,\u0026rdquo; you should probably use this word rather than using your language\u0026rsquo;s word for \u0026ldquo;servant.\u0026rdquo;\n  In Kiswahili, for example, the word for \u0026ldquo;servant\u0026rdquo; is mhudumu \u0026lsquo;one who serves,\u0026rsquo; but service books do not use this word for deacons. Instead, they use the word shemasi, which comes from the Arabic word شماس shmas which means \u0026ldquo;servant.\u0026rdquo; In Arabic Orthodox texts, شماس shmas is always used to refer to a deacon.\n STEP 5. CHECK to see if your Bishop has instructions about how this term is to be translated.\nSTEP 6. After making a tentative decision, TEST the term you have tentatively chosen by using it in your translation.\n EXERCISE 1\n  For each of the words listed below, make a study of the meaning of that word in liturgical service books. To make this study, use\n   (1)\n    (2)\n    (3)\n   For each word, make a short list of the facts about the meaning of the word which you feel are most important to consider when translating. Words to study:\n   (a) sacrament/ mystery (μυστήριον mysterion)\n    (b)\n    (c)\n    (d)\n  "
